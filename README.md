# Project 2 - *Yelp?*

**Yelp?** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **~20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Filter page
   - [x] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch. **I just change the tint color red**
   - [x] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [x]  Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Refactored the provided Yelp client to use a Builder instead of telescopic constructors.
- [x] Uses the current user location for the searches.
- [x] No results cell.
- [x] Header shows the number of results.
- [x] Supports device rotation using auto-layout to adjust for landscape.
- [x] Tapping the address on the business details screen opens Map app.
- [x] Tapping phone number on the business details screen opens options like call, add to contacts, and the like
- [x] Tapping "See more details" on the business details screen opens the Yelp page for the business on Safari. In my case because I have the original Yelp app installed, it eventually opens the business page on the Yelp app. 


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories (Tap the screenshot to watch on Youtube):

[![Walktrough](http://img.youtube.com/vi/thKbapWvnmI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/thKbapWvnmI)

Because it uses location I decided to use my iPod Touch for the walktrough, capturing the screen with QuickTime. I didn't manage to find a tool
to convert the video to animated gif, so I uploaded the walktrough to Youtube.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
